      Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam. Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur! Oh, you did it!

      Princess...we have a visitor. We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east. It's metal. Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke. It could be a speeder, one of ours. No. Wait - there's something very weak coming through. Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code. It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out. Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.

      ...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed. No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found. Lord Vader. Yes, Admiral, what is it? The Emperor commands you make contact with him. Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission. Yes, my lord.

      Artoo! You be more careful. Artoo - that way! Artoo! Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste very good. Anything broken? If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy.

      Luke...Luke. Ben? You will go to the Dagobah system. Dagobah system? There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me. Ben...Ben. Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here. Not much time. Ben...Ben... Hang on, kid. Dagobah system... Whew... Dagobah... This may smell bad, kid... Yoda... but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built. Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
